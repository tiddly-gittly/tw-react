# TiddlyWiki React

[Whatâ€™s your opinion about using ReactJS in the plugin?](https://talk.tiddlywiki.org/t/whats-your-opinion-about-using-reactjs-in-the-plugin/2191) Sometimes it is inevitable to use ReactJS in the widget, for example, JSONSchemaForm.

## Trouble shotting

### React is undefined

You may need `import React from 'react';` on the top of jsx file, even you are in react 17+ and not using this variable...

### My css is not loading

See things in your `dist/plugins/xxx/yyy`, is there a `zzz.css` file?

Then you will need to create a `zzz.css.meta` file in your src folder:

```tid
title: $:/plugins/linonetwo/flowtiwi-sidebar/flowtiwi-sidebar.css
tags: $:/tags/Stylesheet
type: text/css
```
